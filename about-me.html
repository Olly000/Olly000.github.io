                </div>
                <p>
                    My main interest outside of work is music, both as a creator and enthusiast.  I am involved in two bands as a musician, songwriter and recordist playing guitar, bass and synthesizer: <a href="http://www.pelts.band/">Pelts</a> and <a href="https://betatonedistraction.bandcamp.com/">Betatone Distraction. </a> The collaborative nature of these projects has greatly expanded my team-working skills, by valuing the input of others and being willing to concede that another team member has come up with a superior idea; and in terms of working collectively to achieve group goals.  As I have functioned as producer/recordist for several of our releases I have also had to use project management skills to ensure the whole team were able to contribute their best to recordings; and to ensure that a high-quality finished product was created.  The success of this process was validated by our music receiving both regional and national radio play.
In addition to this I make experimental electronic music on my own as <a href="https://indigoguy.bandcamp.com/music">indigoguy</a> using a range of tools, from analogue synthesisers to digital audio workstations. I find the free-from nature of this practice allows me to fully explore my creative side.
